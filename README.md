# ipsy

Ipsy is a tool for applying IPS (International/Internal Patch System) files. They are typically used for distributing emulator ROM changes as distributing the patched ROM would violate copyright law.

Please see the [readthedocs](http://ipsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page for more information.

You can now install ipsy-0.2 via pypi `pip3 install ipsy`
